<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Membrane</li><li>Non-absorbable Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) membrane market consists of two primary types: absorbable and non-absorbable membranes. Absorbable membranes are designed to degrade naturally over time, eliminating the need for surgical removal, making them convenient for clinicians and patients. In contrast, non-absorbable membranes remain in place until surgically removed, providing longer-term structural support. Both types are utilized in dental and orthopedic procedures to facilitate tissue regeneration and improve healing outcomes by preventing unwanted tissue growth and promoting targeted regeneration.</p></p>
