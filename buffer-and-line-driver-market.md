<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Buffer and Line Driver Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Three States</li><li>Open Drain</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Buffer and Line Driver market types include three states (high, low, and high-impedance) and open drain configurations. In the high state, the output voltage is close to the supply voltage, while in the low state, the output voltage is close to ground. In the high-impedance state, the output is disconnected from the circuit. Open drain configuration allows multiple devices to share a single communication line by pulling the line low to transmit a logic 0 and releasing it to allow a logic 1.</p></p>
