<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bipolar Transistors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PNP</li><li>NPN</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bipolar transistors, categorized into NPN and PNP types, are essential components in electronics. NPN transistors use a negative-positive-negative configuration, functioning effectively in switching and amplification tasks by allowing current to flow from the collector to the emitter when triggered by a base current. PNP transistors, on the other hand, have a positive-negative-positive structure, where current flows from the emitter to the collector, activated by a base current that pulls the voltage down. Both types cater to diverse applications in various markets.</p></p>
