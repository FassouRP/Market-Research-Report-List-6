<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electro-magnetic Brakes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Off Brake</li><li>Power On Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electro-magnetic brakes are classified into two main types: power-off brakes and power-on brakes. Power-off brakes engage when electrical power is removed, utilizing spring force to apply the brake, ensuring safety during power failures. Conversely, power-on brakes remain engaged while power is supplied, using electromagnetic force to hold the brake open; these are often used in systems requiring constant operation. The choice between these types depends on application needs, safety considerations, and operational efficiency in various industries.</p></p>
