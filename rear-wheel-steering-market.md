<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rear Wheel Steering Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Steering</li><li>Active Steering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rear-wheel steering market can be classified into two main types: passive steering and active steering. Passive steering involves the rear wheels turning in response to the front wheel movement, enhancing stability and maneuverability at low speeds without driver input. Active steering, on the other hand, uses electronic systems to dynamically adjust the rear wheel angle based on speed and driving conditions, providing improved handling and agility at various speeds. Both types aim to enhance vehicle performance and driver experience.</p></p>
