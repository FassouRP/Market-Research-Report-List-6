<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submucosal Lifting Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution</li><li>Gel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The submucosal lifting agent market consists of two primary types: solutions and gels. Solutions are typically liquid formulations that facilitate easy injection under the mucosal layer, providing effective elevation during endoscopic procedures. Gels, on the other hand, are thicker, viscous substances that offer sustained lifting and greater stability, minimizing the risk of rapid absorption. Both types are essential for enhancing visibility and accessibility in minimally invasive surgeries, particularly in gastrointestinal and urological applications, where precise lifting is crucial for successful outcomes.</p></p>
