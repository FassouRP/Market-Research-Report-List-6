<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Peripheral Stent Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare Metal Stents</li><li>Covered Stents</li><li>Drug Eluting Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The peripheral stent implants market consists of three main types: bare metal stents, covered stents, and drug-eluting stents. Bare metal stents provide basic structural support to keep arteries open without any coating; however, they may lead to restenosis. Covered stents, featuring a protective layer, help reduce tissue growth and are used in thrombosed or damaged vessels. Drug-eluting stents release medication over time to inhibit restenosis and promote healing, making them a preferred choice for many patients requiring vascular interventions.</p></p>
