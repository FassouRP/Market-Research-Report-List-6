<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Barrier Membranes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resorbable Membranes</li><li>Non-resorbable Membranes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The barrier membranes market is primarily divided into two types: resorbable and non-resorbable membranes. Resorbable membranes are designed to be gradually absorbed by the body, eliminating the need for surgical removal while promoting tissue regeneration. In contrast, non-resorbable membranes are intended to provide a permanent barrier, requiring extraction after their purpose is fulfilled. Both types are widely used in dental and surgical procedures to guide tissue regeneration and manage bone defects, reinforcing their significance in regenerative medicine.</p></p>
